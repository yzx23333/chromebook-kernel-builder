# Chromebook Custom Kernel Builder

A layered kernel build system for x86_64 and ARM64 (aarch64) Chromebooks
running any Debian-based Linux distribution. x86_64 builds are per-device;
ARM64 builds are per device *family* — one kernel whose FIT image carries
all family DTBs, with depthcharge selecting the right one at boot.

x86_64 builds are designed to work alongside
[WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio)
for boards that need UCM/topology files installed after boot.

ARM64 builds target [velvet-os](https://github.com/velvet-os/velvet-os.github.io)
and are managed on-device using
[velvet-tools](https://github.com/velvet-os/velvet-tools).

## The Problem This Solves

Stock distro kernels don't always work correctly on Chromebook hardware.
Some platforms benefit from specific kernel compile-time options or config
tweaks that can't easily be fixed after the fact — this project is a
starting point for building kernels that address those gaps on a
per-platform and per-device basis.

A few examples:

**AMD Stoneyridge — e.g., Acer CB315-2H, Lenovo 300e Gen2 AMD:**
Some Stoney boards work better with GPU firmware compiled directly into
the kernel rather than loaded as a module, which can help the audio
subsystem initialize correctly on boot.

**MediaTek MT8183 — e.g., HP Chromebook 11MK G9 EE (esche):**
ARM64 Chromebooks using depthcharge require a FIT image (kernel + device
tree blobs) packed into a signed kpart. There is no initramfs: USB storage
and the btrfs root filesystem are built into the kernel, `rootwait` covers
USB enumeration, and `root=` must use a kernel-resolvable form
(`PARTUUID=`/`PARTLABEL=` — filesystem `LABEL=` needs an initramfs and
will panic).

These configs are not guaranteed to be perfect for every board or use
case — they are a community-maintained starting point. Testing and
contributions are very welcome.

---

## Audio Support

### x86_64

For most x86 platforms, install the kernel then run
[chromebook-linux-audio](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio)
to install UCM configs and topology files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio
cd chromebook-linux-audio && sudo ./setup-audio
```

**Stoney Ridge (6.19+):** Some users have reported full audio including
microphone working on a pristine install with no additional steps required.
Your experience may vary — if audio does not work,
[chromebook-linux-audio](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio)
is the recommended next step.

### ARM64 (MT8183)

chromebook-linux-audio is x86-only and does not support ARM platforms.
Audio support for MT8183 depends on mainline ASoC drivers and is handled
differently per board. This is an area where community contributions and
testing reports are especially welcome.

---

## Config Layer Architecture

Every kernel config is assembled from layers merged in order.
Later layers override earlier ones for any conflicting option.

### x86_64

```
Layer 0 — BASE (always applied)
  configs/base/chromebooks-x86_64.cfg
  Full curated Chromebook config. Contains: CrOS EC, input, MMC, WiFi,
  BT, SOF core, ALSA, common codecs, crypto, filesystems, Virtio, etc.

Layer 1 — PLATFORM (per SoC family)
  configs/platform/<platform>.cfg
  Contains: GPU driver settings, SOF/ACP backend, platform-specific
            codecs, built-in firmware requirements.

Layer 2 — DEVICE (per board codename, optional)
  configs/device/<codename>.cfg
  Contains: only what differs from the platform default
            (e.g., specific codec present/absent on this board)
```

The merge uses the kernel's own `scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh`.

### ARM64

The ARM64 pipeline replicates hexdump0815's exact build process, then adds
local fixes and device overrides on top. Two repos are cloned at build time:

```
ARM64_EXTERNAL_REPO_URL_MEDIATEK  → linux-mainline-mediatek-mt81xx-kernel
ARM64_KERNEL_CONFIG_OPTIONS_URL   → kernel-config-options
```

Layer order (mirrors hexdump0815's readme.mt8 pipeline exactly):

```
Layer 0 — ARM64 DEFCONFIG
  arch/arm64/configs/defconfig
  Standard ARM64 starting point, same as hexdump's pipeline.

Layer 1 — GENERIC CHROMEBOOK ARM64
  kernel-config-options/chromebooks-aarch64.cfg

Layer 2 — PLATFORM SPECIFIC
  kernel-config-options/mediatek.cfg  (or rockchip.cfg etc.)

Layer 3 — DOCKER / CONTAINER SUPPORT
  kernel-config-options/docker-options.cfg

Layer 4 — GENERIC REMOVALS
  kernel-config-options/options-to-remove-generic.cfg

Layer 5 — PLATFORM REMOVALS
  misc.cbm/options/options-to-remove-special.cfg

Layer 6 — GENERIC ADDITIONS
  kernel-config-options/additional-options-generic.cfg

Layer 7 — ARM64 ADDITIONS
  kernel-config-options/additional-options-aarch64.cfg

Layer 8 — PLATFORM ADDITIONS
  misc.cbm/options/additional-options-special.cfg

  make ARCH=arm64 olddefconfig run after all hexdump layers.

Layer 9 — LOCAL PLATFORM CONFIG (our additions, applied LAST)
  configs/platform/<platform>.cfg
  Guarantees critical options for this SoC family regardless of what
  hexdump's stack provides. e.g. configs/platform/mediatek-mt81xx.cfg
  Add a new file here when adding a new ARM64 platform.

Layer 10 — ARM64 COMMON FIXES (our additions, applied LAST)
  configs/base/arm64-common-fixes.cfg
  Fixes for issues found in hexdump's pipeline. These are candidates
  to PR back to hexdump0815's kernel-config-options repo.

Layer 11 — DEVICE (per board codename, optional)
  configs/device/<codename>.cfg
  Only options absent from or wrong in hexdump's full stack.
  Keep this minimal. NOTE: arm64 family builds pass the family name
  here, so per-codename overlays no longer apply to arm64 — family-wide
  options belong in the platform fragment (Layer 9). A device that truly
  needs different options needs its own platform value in
  hardware_map.conf.
```

Fallback: if `ARM64_KERNEL_CONFIG_OPTIONS_URL` is not set, the pipeline
falls back to using `configs/base/<platform>.cfg` (if it contains CONFIG_
lines) or hexdump's `config.cbm` directly.

The ARM64 merge is handled by `scripts/merge_kernel_config_arm64.sh`.

## Quick Start (x86_64)

### Install build dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential bc bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev \
     libncurses-dev dwarves pahole debhelper rsync ccache zstd
```

### Build for the current machine (auto-detect):

```bash
sudo ./scripts/build_kernel.sh
```

### Build for a specific codename:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/build_kernel.sh --codename aleena
```

### Start from your running kernel config:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/build_kernel.sh --codename aleena --base-config running
```

### Dry run (no build):

```bash
./scripts/build_kernel.sh --codename treeya --dry-run
```

### Build and install in one step:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/build_kernel.sh --codename aleena --install
```

---

## GitHub Actions

This repo includes workflows that build kernels automatically on push
or on a weekly schedule, publishing artifacts to the
[Releases](../../releases) page.

### Commit message triggers

Push builds are controlled by tags in the commit message. No tag means
no build — this prevents every commit from triggering a full kernel build.

| Commit message | Effect |
|---|---|
| `[build:all]` | Build all platforms, default kernel version |
| `[build:stoney-ridge]` | Build one platform, default kernel version |
| `[build:esche]` | Build the family containing that device (arm64) |
| `[build:all][kernel:6.12]` | Build all, resolve latest 6.12.x |
| `[build:esche][kernel:6.12.80]` | Build one family, exact kernel version |
| `[build:stoney-ridge][kernel:6.19.6]` | Build one platform, exact version |

The `[kernel:x.y]` tag resolves the latest point release in that series.
The `[kernel:x.y.z]` tag uses that exact version directly.
Omitting `[kernel:]` uses the default series from `configs/kernel_versions.conf`.

### Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

1. Go to **Actions** → select the relevant workflow
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Optionally specify a kernel series, platform, or codename filter
4. Download artifacts from the completed run, or wait for the release to publish

### Weekly schedule

Builds run automatically every Sunday — x86_64 at 02:00 UTC, ARM64 at
04:00 UTC — and publish a pre-release to the
[Releases](../../releases) page. No commit needed.

### Workflows

- **build.yml** — x86_64 Chromebooks, produces `.deb` packages
- **build_arm64.yml** — ARM64 Chromebooks, one build per device family
  (mt81xx, rk33xx), each producing a signed kpart tarball for velvet-os

---

## ARM64 device families (velvet-os)

ARM64 builds target [velvet-os](https://github.com/velvet-os/velvet-os.github.io)
images. The GitHub Actions workflow produces one `.tar.gz` per device
family containing the signed kpart, Image, all family DTBs, and kernel
modules. The FIT image inside the kpart carries every DTB the family's
`DTB_PREFIX` globs match, and depthcharge selects the correct one by
compatible string — so one tarball boots every family member.

On-device kernel management is handled by
[velvet-tools](https://github.com/velvet-os/velvet-tools), which
automates test-booting and permanently flashing new kernels via the
two depthcharge kernel partitions.

### Supported devices

| Family | Codename | Device | SoC | DTB glob |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mt81xx | esche | HP Chromebook 11MK G9 EE | MT8183 | mt8183-kukui-* |
| mt81xx | oak | Samsung Chromebook Plus | MT8173 | mt8173-elm-* |
| rk33xx | kevin | Samsung Chromebook Plus | RK3399 | rk3399-gru-* |
| rk33xx | bob | Asus Chromebook Flip C101PA | RK3399 | rk3399-gru-* |

Because DTBs are collected by glob, the family tarball implicitly covers
every board those globs match — all kukui variants (Acer 311, Lenovo
Duet, Lenovo 10e, ...), hana (Lenovo N23), and the gru boards — not just
the codenames listed. A device only needs its own `hardware_map.conf`
row to be targetable by `[build:<codename>]` filters or to add a new
DTB glob to its family; boards sharing an existing glob boot the
existing tarball as-is. Testing reports welcome — see
[Contributing](#contributing).

### Installing a new kernel on velvet-os

**Prerequisites:** velvet-tools must be installed on the target system.
See [velvet-tools](https://github.com/velvet-os/velvet-tools) for
installation instructions.

**Tarball naming convention:**
```
linux-<kver>-<date>-r<N>.tar.gz

Example:
linux-7.0.3-velvet-mt81xx-20260506-r47.tar.gz
```

`<kver>` is the kernel release string (`uname -r`) and already encodes
the family:
```
<x.y.z>-velvet-<family>

Example:
7.0.3-velvet-mt81xx
```

**1. Download the tarball** from the [Releases](../../releases) page and
extract it to the root of your velvet-os install:

```bash
sudo tar xzf linux-7.0.3-velvet-mt81xx-<date>-r<N>.tar.gz -C /
```

This places the kernel Image, DTBs, modules, and kpart under `/boot` and
`/lib/modules`.

**2. Check what was installed:**

```bash
sudo vtlist
```

Look for the newly extracted kernel — it will appear as:
`7.0.3-velvet-mt81xx`

**3. Build and flash the kpart:**

```bash
sudo vtbuild 7.0.3-velvet-mt81xx
```

`vtbuild` rebuilds the signed kpart incorporating the correct cmdline
(including `KERNEL_HASH` and `ipv6.disable=1`) and test-flashes it to
the secondary kernel partition. If `init_gen_hook=y` is set in
`/etc/velvettools/config` (the default), this step runs automatically
after the tar extraction — you can skip it if so.

**4. Reboot** — depthcharge boots once from the secondary partition.
On successful boot, `vtcheck` permanently promotes the new kernel to
the primary partition. If the boot fails, depthcharge automatically
falls back to the previous kernel on the next boot.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### velvet-os partition layout (USB)

| Partition | Label | Role |
|---|---|---|
| sda1 | — | Primary kernel (kpart, depthcharge) |
| sda2 | — | Secondary kernel (test boots) |
| sda3 | bootpart | /boot (ext4) |
| sda4 | rootpart | / (btrfs) |

### Useful velvet-tools commands

```bash
vtlist                    # list available kernel versions
vtbuild <kver>            # rebuild kpart for a kernel version
vttest <kver> /dev/sda    # manually test-flash to secondary partition
vtflash <kver> /dev/sda   # permanently flash to primary partition
vtdisable /dev/sda        # make a partition unbootable
```

For full documentation see
[velvet-tools](https://github.com/velvet-os/velvet-tools) and the
[velvet-os kernel docs](https://github.com/velvet-os/velvet-os.github.io/tree/main/chromebooks/kernel).

## Installing a Pre-built x86_64 Kernel

```bash
# Find your board codename
cat /sys/class/dmi/id/board_name

# Look up your platform in hardware_map.conf, then install
PLATFORM=stoney-ridge
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-*-chromebook-${PLATFORM}*.deb \
             linux-headers-*-chromebook-${PLATFORM}*.deb

# Pin to prevent apt upgrades overwriting this kernel
sudo cp 99-chromebook-kernel-${PLATFORM} /etc/apt/preferences.d/

# Reboot, then set up audio if needed
git clone https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio
cd chromebook-linux-audio && sudo ./setup-audio
```

---

## Adding a New Device

If your board isn't in `hardware_map.conf`:

```bash
# Auto-detect current hardware and register it
sudo ./scripts/add_device.sh

# Or specify manually
sudo ./scripts/add_device.sh --codename mynewboard --platform intel-alderlake
```

Then edit `configs/device/mynewboard.cfg` to add any board-specific
overrides (codec drivers, disabled options, etc.) and rebuild.

---

## APT Pinning

After a successful build, `install_apt_pin.sh` writes a pin file which:

- Pins your custom kernel at priority **1001** (protected from all upgrades)
- Blocks kernel meta-packages at priority **-1** (never auto-install)
- Runs `apt-mark hold` as a second layer of protection

Check the pin is working:
```bash
apt-cache policy linux-image-$(uname -r)
# Should show: *** <version> 1001
```

Remove pinning to replace the kernel:
```bash
sudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/99-chromebook-kernel-<platform>
sudo apt-mark unhold linux-image-<version> linux-headers-<version>
```

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — the configs in this repo are a starting point,
not a finished product, and real-world testing on real hardware is the only
way to improve them.

### Adding a new x86_64 device

**Files to edit or create:**

| File | Required | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `configs/hardware_map.conf` | ✅ | Add one line for your board |
| `configs/device/<codename>.cfg` | ✅ | Create with any board-specific overrides (can be empty) |
| `patches/<platform>/` | only if needed | Drop a `.patch` file here if your board needs a kernel patch |

**`hardware_map.conf` format:**
```
CODENAME|PLATFORM|KERNEL_SERIES|PATCH_DIR|ARCH|DTB_PREFIX|NOTES
```

Example:
```
myboard|intel-cometlake|default|none|x86_64|none|Acme Chromebook XYZ
```

- `CODENAME` — ChromeOS board codename (check `cat /sys/class/dmi/id/board_name`)
- `PLATFORM` — must match an existing `configs/platform/<platform>.cfg`
- `KERNEL_SERIES` — use `default` unless your board needs a specific series (e.g. `6.12`)
- `PATCH_DIR` — subdirectory under `patches/` to apply, or `none`
- `ARCH` — `x86_64` for Intel/AMD boards
- `DTB_PREFIX` — `none` for x86_64 boards
- `NOTES` — human-readable device name

**`configs/device/<codename>.cfg`:**
Only include options that differ from the platform default. If the platform
config works as-is, the file can be empty. Do not copy the entire platform
config — keep it minimal.

---

### Adding a new ARM64 device

ARM64 builds run entirely through GitHub Actions — there is no local build
script. Adding a device means adding config files; the CI pipeline handles
the rest.

**Config layering for ARM64** — understand this before creating files:

The pipeline replicates hexdump0815's exact build process using two repos
cloned automatically at build time — you do not need to copy or maintain
any of those files. Your only contributions are:

- `configs/base/arm64-common-fixes.cfg` — for fixes that apply to all ARM64
  builds and should eventually be PRed back to hexdump0815
- `configs/platform/<platform>.cfg` — guarantees critical options for an
  SoC family regardless of what hexdump's stack provides. Create one when
  adding a new platform (e.g. `configs/platform/rockchip-rk33xx.cfg`)
- `configs/device/<codename>.cfg` — for options specific to one board that
  hexdump's full stack doesn't set correctly

Both are applied last, after all of hexdump's layers, so they cannot be
overridden. Keep device configs minimal — if hexdump already provides it
correctly, don't repeat it here.

**Files to edit or create:**

| File | Required | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `configs/hardware_map.conf` | ✅ | Add one line for your board |
| `configs/device/<codename>.cfg` | ✅ | Create with board-specific overrides only (can be empty) |
| `configs/cmdline/<codename>.cmdline` | only if needed | Create if your board needs different kernel parameters than the platform default |
| `patches/<platform>/` | only if needed | Drop a `.patch` file here for device-specific kernel patches |

**`hardware_map.conf` entry for ARM64:**
```
myboard|mediatek-mt81xx|default|none|arm64|mt8183-kukui|Acme Chromebook ARM
```

Note: `ARCH` must be `arm64` and `DTB_PREFIX` must match the DTB glob prefix
for your SoC (e.g. `mt8183-kukui`, `rk3399-gru`) — this is what tells the
build workflow which device tree blobs to include in the kpart.

**Platform-level patches** (mt8183 and mt81xx patches) are automatically
pulled from the upstream hexdump0815 repo at build time — you do not need
to include those. Only add patches to `patches/<platform>/` if your device
needs something board-specific on top of the upstream set.

**Cmdline fallback order** — the build looks for cmdline files in this order:
1. `configs/cmdline/<codename>.cmdline` — your device
2. `configs/cmdline/<platform>.cmdline` — your platform
3. `configs/cmdline/chromebook-kukui.cmdline` — generic MT8183 fallback

If the generic kukui cmdline works for your board, no cmdline file is needed.

---

### What to include in a Pull Request

Whether x86_64 or ARM64, a good PR includes:

- **The config files** — `hardware_map.conf` entry + `configs/device/<codename>.cfg`
- **Board codename and full device name**
- **Kernel version tested** (from `uname -r`)
- **What works** — boot, WiFi, display, keyboard/touchpad, audio, suspend, camera
- **What doesn't work or is untested**
- **For ARM64** — which DTB was used, whether velvet-tools handled the kpart
  correctly, and whether any cmdline changes were needed

Keep the PR focused on one device. If you find a fix that helps the whole
platform (not just your board), note that in the PR description and we can
apply it to the platform config instead.

---

### Not ready to open a PR? Open an Issue instead

If you've tested a kernel on your device but aren't sure the config is
ready to merge, open an **Issue** using the *Device Support* template.
Partial reports — even just "it boots and WiFi works" — are useful for
tracking community coverage across devices.

---

### General guidelines

- Keep device configs minimal — if an option fixes something that affects
  the whole SoC family, it belongs in the platform config, not the device config
- If a config option fixes a regression, note the kernel version where it
  was introduced
- Tested-on reports in PRs and Issues are just as valuable as code changes
